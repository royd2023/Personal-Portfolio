# Roy Dinh's Personal Portfolio

This is a full-stack personal portfolio project for Roy Dinh, featuring a modern, animated React frontend and an Express/Node.js backend with OpenAI integration. The site showcases Roy's skills, experience, and interests, and includes an interactive AI chatbot ("RoyAI") that can answer questions about Roy and basic computer science concepts.

## Features

### üåå Modern Animated Frontend

- **Full-Screen Sections:**  
  Each section (Intro, Languages, Frontend, Backend, Databases, Tools, Learning) spans the entire viewport, creating a clean, immersive experience.
- **Smooth Scroll Animations:**  
  As you scroll, each section fades in with a modern animation using Framer Motion.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes.
- **Dark Theme:**  
  Uses a deep blue/purple gradient background with glassmorphism effects for cards and sections.
- **Profile Picture:**  
  Prominently displays a circular profile picture (with a placeholder image if not set).
- **Top Bar:**  
  Fixed top bar with Roy's name and a creative GitHub link (with icon and hover effects) that fades out as you scroll.
- **RoyAI Chatbot:**  
  A floating RoyAI button opens a chat window where users can interact with a digital version of Roy.
